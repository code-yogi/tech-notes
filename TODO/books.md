* Current Priorities:
    * Distributed Algorithms
    * Distributed Systems
    * Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach
    * Intro to linear algebra

* Algorithm Design (Tardos)
    * Could have a useful chapter on local search.
    * No priority.
* Approximation Algorithms (Vazirani)
    * This collects algorithms to a variety of problems. Not really
      interesting from a general learning standpoint.
    * No priority.
* Art of Electronics
    * I just don't understand electronics that well. This book is too
      hard, and it's not really in the wheelhouse of my interest area.
    * No priority.
* Art of Multiprocessor Programming
    * Lots of useful details, but I know most of this stuff now.
    * Has interesting stuff on hardware and cache-consistency.
    * No priority.
* Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach
    * *High priority*
* Big Data: Principles and Best Practices of Scalable Real-time Data Systems
    * TODO: REVIEW ME!
    * *High Priority*
* Bitcoin for the Befuddled
    * Read whole thing. No interesting material left to read.
    * No priority.
* Causality
    * TODO AT ANTHONY (AI)
* C++: Concurrency in Action
    * I think I actually know all the stuff in this. Has some good C++
      implementation stuff about concurrent datastructures, but I
      already wrote up all that stuff.
    * No priority.
* Database Systems (Garcia-Molina)
    * Read everything in this book. Good stuff on implementation of
      DBs.
* Distributed Algorithms (Lynch)
    * Looks like it has a wealth of useful information.
    * *High Priority*
* Distributed Systems (Coulouris)
    * Ch10 P2P. Ch12 Distributed FS. Ch14-18 is clocks (read),
      coordination, concurrency control, distributed transactions, and
      replication.
    * *High priority*.
* Div Grad Curl And All That
    * No priority. I can review this if I really need it...
* Elements of Computing Systems
    * Loaned to Stefano.
    * Great book. Most of it I already know, but stuff about boolean
      circuits, and also memory (implemented as delay) was fascinating.
* Elements of Statistical Learning
    * Really hard, should do Strang and Norvig AI first.
    * Also: has a bunch of stuff on trees.
    * *Low priority*
* Intro to Algorithms (CLRS)
    * Great resource, but I already know everything I need from here.
* Intro To Linear Algebra
    * Need to learn SVD, I think...
    * Believe I lent this to Anthony.
    * *High priority*
* Machine Learning (Mitchell)
    * TODO AT HOME (AI)
* Machine Learning (Murphy)
    * Looks like a great book. Very comprehensive; covers
      *everything*.
        * Except cheaps out on NNs.
    * Would make this one of the first AI books I read after Norvig.
    * TODO AT HOME (AI)
* Mastering Web Application Development with AngularJS
    * This was a shit book, and I moved on to React.
    * No priority.
* Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Bishop)
    * TODO AT HOME (AI)
* Principles of Distributed Database Systems
    * TODO: REVIEW ME!
    * *High Priority*
* Probabilistic Graphical Models
    * Already learned most of this through the PGM course.
    * TODO AT WORK (AI)
* Probabilistic Robotics
    * TODO AT WORK (AI)
* Programming Collective Intelligence (Segaran)
    * TODO AT HOME (AI)
* Purely Functional Datastructures
    * Exhausted this book mostly. Prolly have done enough persistent
      algorithms for a lifetime.
    * No priority.
* Quantum Computation and Quantum Information (Nielsen and Chaung)
    * No priority. Too hard for me to understand right now.
* Quantum Computing Since Democritus
    * Great book, but pretty stuck on this.
    * *Low Priority*
* Randomized Algorithms (Motwani and Raghavan)
    * Looks to be more technical and detailed than I care about.
    * No priority.
* Real World Haskell
    * Pretty shit book. Ch14,15,18 are all about monads, might be
      worth it. Ch24 and 28 and are about parallel programming and
      STM.
    * No priority.
* Structure and Interpreation of Computer Programs
    * Just wasn't that interesting. Probably came too late to
      influence my thinking.
    * No priority.
