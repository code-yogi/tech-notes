* Looks like they use some kind of Dell server with 4 CPU sockets.
* Entire SO database is 1.5TB. They keep it all in RAM.

## More Reasonable

* Gfx Card: EVGA GeForce GTX 980 Ti 06G-P4-4995-KR $630
    * Most reviewed 980 Ti.
    * People love EVGA.
    * Everyone says focus on gfx card for VR.
    * Could save $30 max for 980Ti.
    * $509 for top reviewed 980 04G-P4-2983-KR.
    * $340 for EVGA 970.
* Motherboard: ASUS Z170-A $135
    * Most reviewed sub $200 motherboard
    * No cheaper, frequently reviewed motherboards. This is a good
      deal!
    * Asrock has a $79 board, but it doesn't have SLI.
    * I think I'd pay $55 to have a shot at SLI in the future.
* RAM: GSkill F4-3200C16D-16GTZB $90
    * $80; pretty competitive price for 16GB. Can save max $15 here.
    * Faster RAM seems bogus.
    * Save $35 max by dropping to lowest speed 16GB RAM.
* PSU: SeaSonic X Series X650 Gold $110
    * Modular. SLI ready.
    * Can't see whether the Raidmax is actually modular.
* CPU: Intel Core i5-6600 $230
    * Lowest-end Skylake for Rift/Vive.
    * K just lets you overclock; otherwise operates at same turbo
      speeds. Also I'd have to get my own heatsink which I don't feel
      like.
    * $85 more for 6700, $120 more for 6700K. These have HT and
      operate at higher clockrate, but not needed for VR.
    * Save $40 max by dropping to 6400.
* SSD: SAMSUNG 850 EVO 2.5" 500GB MZ-75E500B/AM $150
    * Most reviewed 500GB drive. Can't have less than 500GB.
    * Cool that PCIe drives exist, but super expensive.
    * Can save max $30 here for no-name SSD. Otherwise would have to
      go smaller.
* Case: Corsair Obsidian Series 450D $125
    * Personal preference. A waste of money, but I hate the rest.
* Fans: 2x Cooler Master Sleeve Bearing 140mm Silent Fan for Computer
  Cases and Radiators $11/ea
    * Most popular, quietest fan.
    * Costs basically nothing.
* Wifi card: TP-LINK Archer T8E AC1750 $65
    * Most don't support AC. This has 3 antennae.
    * Other options aren't much cheaper anyway.
* Microsoft Windows 10 Home - 64-bit - OEM ($100)
    * I think you can download this; you can install off USB.
