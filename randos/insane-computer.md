* Looks like they use some kind of Dell server with 4 CPU sockets.

## More Reasonable

* CPU: i7-6700 ~$310 (High end, but not unreasonable; could save up to
  $100 if go down to i5)
* Motherboard: ASUS Z170-A $135 (this is like what a motherboard
  costs; highly reviewed; actually on the low cost side)
* RAM: F4-3400C16D-16GTZ $110 (One of the cheaper 16GB options; good
  price for this much ram; could save ~$10-20 if slower RAM)
* Power supply: RAIDMAX HYBRID 2 RX-530SS 530W ATX12V $40 (very
  reasonable, very highly reviewed; modular; cheap as can be expected)
* Graphics card: GIGABYTE GeForce GTX 970 4GB G1 GAMING OC EDITION $339
    * Can save at most $40 for very low reviewed item. Has lots of
      reviews.
* Hard drive: SAMSUNG 850 EVO 2.5" 500GB $150 (very highly considered;
  other top reviewed items around the same price)
* Case: Corsair Obsidian Series 450D ~$125
    * Not hyper popular, but I think this is what I want.
* Fans: 2x Cooler Master Sleeve Bearing 140mm Silent Fan for Computer
  Cases and Radiators $20

    * $1,362.55

    * I think you can download this; you can install off USB.
