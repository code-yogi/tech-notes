**TODO**: This is a list of CPU architecture subjects. I thought I
wrote all this stuff up long ago... I don't have time right now for
this, but these are the main subjects to writeup when I get around to
it.

## CISC and RISC

CISC combines several operations into a single instruction. In the
early days, CISC was considered an advantage because it meant that
people writing assembly could have an easier life. Also, very early
machines were slow to fetch instructions from memory, so it was a
performance advantage to ask the CPU to do multiple things.

* CISC, RISC
* VLIW, EPIC
* Flynn's Taxonomy (SIMD etc)
* Vectorized instructions
* Instruction pipeline
* Microarchitecture
* Branch Predictor
* Out-of-order execution
    * Memory dependence prediction
    * Hazard, Pipeline stall, bubble
* Superscalar processor
* Hyperthreading, SMT
* Speculative execution
* Vector processor
* NX Bit
