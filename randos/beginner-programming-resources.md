**Ruby Tutorials (Probably don't need now)**
http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html
* Approximately zero exercises.
https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/
* Some exercises, but really simple.
Beginning Ruby
https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-ruby
* Looks kinda like Codecademy
http://prepwork.appacademy.io/mini-curriculum/
* We basically covered this...

**Practice Problems**

http://prepwork.appacademy.io/coding-test-1/practice-problems/
* Pretty good list of 21 problems.
http://prepwork.appacademy.io/coding-test-2/practice-problems/
* Nine somewhat harder problems.
http://codingbat.com/python
* Looks like an okay list of Python problems.
https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/
* Many problems of various difficulty, listed by difficulty.

**Other**

https://github.com/appacademy/appacademy-prep
* **Probably should do after a bunch of problems**.

**Meh**

http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Programming_Tasks
* This seems kinda mediocre. Only listed alphabetically, not by
  difficulty.
https://github.com/karan/Projects/blob/master/README.md
* Again, sort of a hodgepodge of easier and more difficult ones.
http://rubyquiz.com/
* A lot of these are really hard...
http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/02/20/i-need-practice-programming-49-ideas-for-game-clones-to-code/
* These are games you can clone. But not appropriate for our level
  right now.
http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/
* Not that useful. Contains a bunch of projects, but not by
  difficulty, and most are random timesucks.
https://bento.io/grid
* This is a random meta-collection of stuff?
http://programmingbydoing.com/
* This is a tutorial teaching the Java language.
* Not exercises to learn how to program or think about problem
  solving.
https://www.hackerrank.com/
* Looks like it's for people looking for jobs? Needs login.
https://checkio.org/
* Needs login, doesn't look promising. For kids maybe?
https://www.hackerearth.com/
* Also looks like for people who want jobs.
