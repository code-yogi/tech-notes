## Notes

People I skipped tended to be in cryptography, or were primarily known
for applied work on programming languages or operating systems. I did
skip a lot of PL theory people.

Most of these people are big publishers, but not everyone.

## Top Journals

Went on Google scholar and looked where the most cited papers by these
folks were published.

AI/ML:
* Advances in NIPs (Free! Very important.)
* Journal of ML Research (Free!)
* Neural Computation (Not free, but important)
* Machine Learning (less important?)
* Artificial Intelligence (less important?)

Distributed Systems
* CACM (Sent to all ACM members)
* JACM (need to subscribe?)
* ACM TOCS (Transactions On Computer Systems)
* ACM TOPLAS (Transactions ON Programming Languages And Systems)

Algos/Datastructures
* JACM
* CACM
* SIAM Journal of Computing (not free)

Databases
* CACM
* ACM TODS (Transactions On DB Systems)
* ACM SIGMOD (Special Interest Group on Management of Data)

Complexity
* SIAM Journal on Computing
* JACM

## Summary

There are many journals, but **Communications** and **Journal of ACM**
seem to cover a lot. **SIAM Journal on Computing** is also
important. Even in specialist fields, a *lot* of important research
was published in these journals.

ACM Transactions for specific topics were fairly popular; most of
these subject areas aren't actually that interesting to me. Based on
the amount of research that ends up in Communications/Journal, these
specialist journals don't feel very necessary.

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning had their own specific
journals. There are a lot of them, but NIPS is by far the most
important (and free!). Journal of ML Research is quite popular,
whereas Neural Computation is popular for the NN set. Machine Learning
and Artificial Intelligence seem like they used to be more popular
than they currently are.

## More Randos

I discovered these people (some of whom I've known before) while
looking at top cited ACM articles.

* Ken Birman
* Sanjeev Arora
* Maurice Herlihy
* Chandra-Toueg

## Papers

I compiled a list of papers on Google Drive.

I found this by looking at top ACM, SIAM papers. I also searched for
all the top computer scientists I've listed elsewhere.
