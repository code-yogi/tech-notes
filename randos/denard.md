Moore's law talks about exponential growth in the number of transitors
that can be efficiently placed on a chip.

Denard scaling says that this leads to closer circuits, decreasing
delay (increasing frequency), and decreasing power consumption per
transistor (less resistance).

Denard scaling broke down because current leakage is apparently a big
problem at very small sizes. More transistors are being placed, but
can't run them faster.
