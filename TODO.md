**Overall Important/Next Steps**

I should focus primarily on artificial intelligence work. There's lots
of interesting stuff throughout Computer Science, but AI is probably
where the most influential breakthroughs are.

* Distributed Systems:
    * Distributed Algorithms (Lynch, other Distributed Systems book)
    * Distributed databases (I have a book for this too)
    * Especially distributed transactions.
* Euler's identity. Fourier transform.
* Startup AI/ML again.
* How to design Facebook? BigTable+IdempotentMessages+MessageQueue?
  Are distributed transactions that important?
    * May want to study up on Spanner et al.

**Math/ML**

* Euler's identity.
* Can I finish nailing down Fourier Transform. Fast fourier transform?
* OLS vs GLS, and what is the maximum likelihood estimate in each
  case? Heteroscedascity?
    * Another question: Errors-in-Variables models.
    * Most regression assumes regressors are errorless, and noise is
      added in observed variable.
    * That means noise is overwhelmed by signal as output value is
      increased.
* KKT and multiple equality constraints.
* Finish Strang!
* Would be nice to have a sumary of Kolmogorov complexity again.
* Quasi-Newton Methods for hill climbing. Line search, conjugate
  gradient descent. WTF does a symmetric matrix mean? Subgradient
  descent?
* WTF are variational methods?
* Spectral graph theory is another thing I don't understand.

**Randos**

* Parallel Programming: Memory fencing details.
* Electronics: Timers and capacitors
* Programming Languages: Higher Kinded Types?
* Web Programming: Understand Flux/Redux/React router.
* Programming Languages: Learn about lex/yacc some day.
* Quantum Computing:
    * Keep reading Aaronson.
