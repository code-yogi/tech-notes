## Important

Eventually, I should focus primarily on artificial intelligence
work. Other big ideas:

* Massively parallel systems.
* Probabilstic computing.
* Quantum computing.

Distributed databases and systems is also interesting/challenging, but
once I finish studying those, I should pivot around to AI, where the
big prizes are.

**Overall**

* Finish distributed systems readup. Bought a book *focused* on
  distributed DBs.
* Try to figure out distributed transactions.
* Startup AI/ML again.

**Algos/DataStructures**

* *Finish distributed systems chapters. Craft narative. Lynch*
* How can you do distributed ACID transactions?

**Math/ML**

* Can I finish nailing down Fourier Transform. Fast fourier transform?
* OLS vs GLS, and what is the maximum likelihood estimate in each
  case? Heteroscedascity?
    * Another question: Errors-in-Variables models.
    * Most regression assumes regressors are errorless, and noise is
      added in observed variable.
    * That means noise is overwhelmed by signal as output value is
      increased.
* KKT and multiple equality constraints.
* Finish Strang!
* Would be nice to have a sumary of Kolmogorov complexity again.
* Quasi-Newton Methods for hill climbing. Line search, conjugate
  gradient descent. WTF does a symmetric matrix mean? Subgradient
  descent?
* WTF are variational methods?

**Randos**

* I wouldn't mind a little more on memory fencing level concurrency
  stuff.
* Timers and capacitors?
* Higher Kinded Types?
* Understand Flux/Redux/React router.
* Learn about lex/yacc some day.
* Quantum Computing
    * Keep reading Aaronson.
    * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconventional_computing
    * http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/npcomplete.pdf

## Projects

* Building adding lightbulbs!
* Sudoku solving. Chess. Alpha-Beta.
* Parallel sorting. Concurrent Datastructures (LL, Queue,
  HM). Persistent datastructures. Mutexes.
* Click's HM. Probably learn a lot about memory model...
* Databases
    * Keep reading the book!
    * Write a database.
    * How are distributed transactions done?
    * Add 2PL and MVCC concurrency support!
    * Deadlock detection. Serializability for MVCC.
    * Indexes
* Programming Languages
    * https://github.com/kanaka/mal
    * Write a compiler. Interface dispatch, virtual machine. Pointer
      tagging.
    * <del>Write an allocator/garbage collector.</del>
    * Write tail-call optimization.
    * Write coroutines/continuations in C.
    * Write an object system.
    * Write a JIT.
* Distributed Systems, Networking
    * Write a TCP implementation in UDP.
        * Write flow control, congestion control.
    * Write a Raft implementation.
    * Write a BitTorrent implementation, DHT.
* Probabilistic Algorithms
    * Write a TSP solver.
* Write rsync.
* Write our own autocomplete!
