**Overall Important/Next Steps**

I should focus primarily on artificial intelligence work. There's lots
of interesting stuff throughout Computer Science, but AI is probably
where the most influential breakthroughs are.

* Distributed Systems:
    * Distributed Algorithms (Lynch, other Distributed Systems book)
    * Distributed databases (I have a book for this too)
    * Especially distributed transactions.
* Euler's identity. Fourier transform.
* Maybe a little more about text search?
* Startup AI/ML again.

**Math/ML**

* Euler's identity.
* Can I finish nailing down Fourier Transform. Fast fourier transform?
* OLS vs GLS, and what is the maximum likelihood estimate in each
  case? Heteroscedascity?
    * Another question: Errors-in-Variables models.
    * Most regression assumes regressors are errorless, and noise is
      added in observed variable.
    * That means noise is overwhelmed by signal as output value is
      increased.
* KKT and multiple equality constraints.
* Finish Strang!
* Would be nice to have a sumary of Kolmogorov complexity again.
* Quasi-Newton Methods for hill climbing. Line search, conjugate
  gradient descent. WTF does a symmetric matrix mean? Subgradient
  descent?
* WTF are variational methods?

**Randos**

* Parallel Programming: Memory fencing details.
* Electronics: Timers and capacitors
* Programming Languages: Higher Kinded Types?
* Web Programming: Understand Flux/Redux/React router.
* Programming Languages: Learn about lex/yacc some day.
* Quantum Computing:
    * Keep reading Aaronson.
    * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconventional_computing
    * http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/npcomplete.pdf

## Projects

* Building adding lightbulbs!
* Sudoku solving. Chess. Alpha-Beta.
* Parallel sorting. Concurrent Datastructures (LL, Queue,
  HM). Persistent datastructures. Mutexes.
* Click's HM. Probably learn a lot about memory model...
* Databases
    * Keep reading the book!
    * Write a database.
    * How are distributed transactions done?
    * Add 2PL and MVCC concurrency support!
    * Deadlock detection. Serializability for MVCC.
    * Indexes
* Programming Languages
    * https://github.com/kanaka/mal
    * Write a compiler. Interface dispatch, virtual machine. Pointer
      tagging.
    * <del>Write an allocator/garbage collector.</del>
    * Write tail-call optimization.
    * Write coroutines/continuations in C.
    * Write an object system.
    * Write a JIT.
* Distributed Systems, Networking
    * Write a TCP implementation in UDP.
        * Write flow control, congestion control.
    * Write a Raft implementation.
    * Write a BitTorrent implementation, DHT.
* Probabilistic Algorithms
    * Write a TSP solver.
* Write rsync.
* Write our own autocomplete!
