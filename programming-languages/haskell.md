This is a list of libraries and extensions things I could study in
Haskell. But I'm pretty anti-Haskell at this time.

* ST Monad
* Lens
* RankNTypes
* Multi parameter classes
* Existential types
* GADT
* NamedFieldPuns and RecordWildCards
* Template Haskell

Other useful:

* Multi-way if
* Pattern guards
