This is a list of AI related online courses. However, I think
`TODO/recommended-online-courses.md` has a better plan of what courses
to take next. When I exhaust those, maybe it makes sense to return to
these.

## Courses I've Taken/Am Taking

* http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/
    * Strang
    * Pretty good. Goes through all the major things I think you're
      supposed to know.
* https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info
    * Andrew Ng
    * This was quite good. A little light on the math sometimes, but
      good.
* https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm
    * Daphne Koller
    * Very serious course with much deeper graphical models and
      techniques.
* https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets
    * Geoff Hinton
    * Serious course.
    * Looks like it has info on RNN and convolutional NN. Hopfield
      nets and Boltzman machines. Belief nets. Autoencoders.
* https://www.coursera.org/course/mmds
    * Mining Massive Data Sets
    * Jeff Ullman
    * Very data mining focused. I see a lot of clustering and LSH
      stuff. Some decision trees.
* https://www.edx.org/course/artificial-intelligence-uc-berkeleyx-cs188-1x
    * No names to me.
    * Looks clearly based on the Norvig AI book. Looks like it has
      some reinforcement learning stuff. Seems pretty OK.

## Other

* Might be nice to take an optimization course: L-BFGS, conjugate
  gradient descent.
    * CVX101 seems to be a good archived course!
    * Actually that doesn't cover conjugate-gradient descent? Or
      quasi-newton methods?
    * Also there's an MIT course.
* https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-artificial-intelligence--cs271
    * Peter Norvig Sebastian Thrun
    * Doesn't look super serious.
* https://www.edx.org/course/scalable-machine-learning-uc-berkeleyx-cs190-1x
    * Scalable Machine Learning
    * No big names.
    * Looks pretty meh. Mostly about Hadoop/Spark for large ML
      problems. Not very long.
* https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373
    * Thrun
    * Kalman filters, PID.
* https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html
    * Learning From Data Caltech
    * Highly rated. Looks like it is broadly similar to Andrew Ng,
      though.
* https://www.edx.org/course/underactuated-robotics-mitx-6-832x-0
    * MIT course. Seems interesting.
* https://www.coursera.org/course/nlp/
    * NLP course by Manning at Stanford. But looks like no archive of
      the material??
* https://class.coursera.org/nlangp-001
    * Columbia NLP course. Seems pretty serious.
* https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120
    * Looks kind of weak. Is taught by Thrun...
* http://cs231n.stanford.edu/
    * Convolutional NN for Visual Recognition.
