## All The Topics!

Focus on artificial intelligence, not machine learning. Only learn the
basics of ML. This is for completeness; what I'm actually interested
in is below.

* Artificial Intelligence
    * Clustering: graphical models, LSH
    * Decision Trees, Random Forests, Boosting
    * Graphical Models (Bayesian Nets, Naive Bayes, Markov Fields, HMM)
    * Nearest Neighbors
    * Neural Nets, Deep Learning
    * NLP
    * Regression (logistic, multinomial, perceptron)
    * Reinforcement Learning
    * Representation of Knowledge
    * Support Vector Machines
* Machine Learning
    * Control Theory (Kalman, optimal control)
    * DSP
    * Optimization (convex, linear, nonlinear, gradient descent)
* Theorem Proving, Symbolic Logic
* Applications
    * Information Retrieval
    * Planning (constraint satistfaction)
    * Robotics
    * Speech Recognition
    * Vision

## Topics That Most Interest Me Most

* Neural Networks, Deep Learning.
* Throwing a distributed system at the problem.
* Reinforcement learning.
* Representation of Knowledge.
* Theorem proving, symbolic logic.
* Robotics.

## Meta

Why am I interested in AI? It's kind of an interesting philosophical
challenge, to replace the concept of knowledge or soul with something
mathematical/biological. It's kind of an interesting revolution.

Maybe a metaphor. I'm interested in theories of morality that are
biological or systematic, or rewrite the concept of morality in the
language of biology or maybe as a function of basic human motivations.

What I'm trying to highlight is that I don't think I'm primarily
motivated by a *practical* reason to go into AI. It's not like it's a
craft I want to exlore (except maybe insofar as distributed systems
help). I'm not actually that deeply idea motivated here.

It's just a note as I think more about where I want to go in CS.
