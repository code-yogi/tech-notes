**Transposes**

So let's talk about transposes. I say that `A\trans x` maps `x` to its
projection on each of the columns of `A`. That's like almost literally
the definition.

We already showed that for any orthonormal matrix, the inverse is
equal to its transpose. For a matrix with skew, the transpose
`A\trans` does not properly invert `x`.

We say a matrix is **symmetric** if it is equal to its own transpose.

`RR\trans`

For **permutation matrices**, the transpose is also the inverse.

**TODO**: They don't say a lot about the transpose as this time.
**TODO**: But I feel like I definitely don't understand it.
