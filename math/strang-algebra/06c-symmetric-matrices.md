Punch line: symmetric matrices can always be diagonalized by an
orthogonal matrix. That is: a symmetric matrix is the result of
pulling on a set of orthogonal basis vectors. (This is the spectral
theorem).

Moreover, real symmetric matrices have all real eigenvalues.

The question. Why?!

Note: in the case of a matrix like the identity with a repeated
eigenvalue, we can actually choose a nonorthogonal vectors, too, but
we can prefer orthogonal ones.


## Hints

Self-adjoint. I think that means that you put me back together the
same way you decompose me.

Inner product `<Ax, y> = <x, Ay>`. Note. This is a property that
depends only on the innerproduct and the transformation defined by
A. Interestingly, A will be symmetric in any basis.x

Could look up this "polar decomposition." This says any non-singular
matrix can be decomposed to a product of an orthogonal matrix and a
symmetric matrix.
