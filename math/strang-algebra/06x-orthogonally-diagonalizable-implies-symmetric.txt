Consider any transformation that is equivalent to a stretching of an
orthogonal basis. Consider the 2d case. Then we have that the basis
must look like:

    (cos \theta, sin \theta)
    # Here I have used orthogonality of the thetas
    (-sin \theta, cos \theta)

So we know that the projection matrix onto the first vector is:

    |cos \theta cos \theta, sin \theta cos \theta|
    |cos \theta sin \theta, sin \theta sin \theta|
    =
    |cos^2 \theta,        , cos \theta sin \theta|
    |cos \theta sin \theta,          sin^2 \theta|

Note that this is a symmetric matrix. Call it A.

The situation flips a bit for the projection onto the orthogonal
vector:

    |-sin \theta -sin \theta, cos \theta -sin \theta|
    |-sin \theta  cos \theta, cos \theta  cos \theta|
    =
    |sin^2 \theta,          -cos \theta sin \theta|
    |-cos \theta sin\theta,           cos^2 \theta|

Call this B.

Therefore, any orthogonal stretching is equal to `alpha A + beta
B`. The sum of two scaled symmetric matrices is still symmetric. Of
course, if alpha = beta = 1 then we get the identity.

Can any symmetric matrix be broken up like this?
