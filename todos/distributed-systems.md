## Priority Plan

I can learn Redis, then let me knock some last theoretical subjects
off my list forever before I get all applied again. In general, I feel
more satisfied now that I understand Cockroach pretty okay.

I'm also feeling more confident that I'm not missing anything about
how people use Cassandra/HBase without transactions.

* **Redis book.**
* Viewstamped Replication
* Virtual Synchrony
* GFS: review that I know exactly how this provides consistency.
* Spanner/F1
* **ElasticSearch book**
* Cassandra book.

## Other

* Docker book.
* **AWS Book.**
* MongoDB book.
