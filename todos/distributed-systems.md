## Priority Plan

I can learn Redis, then let me knock some last theoretical subjects
off my list forever before I get all applied again.

* **Redis book.**
* Viewstamped Replication
* Virtual Synchrony
* GFS: review that I know exactly how this provides consistency.
* Spanner/F1
* **ElasticSearch book**
* Cassandra book.

## Other

* Docker book.
* **AWS Book.**
* MongoDB book.

## Statement

I feel like I've come a long way in my understanding of distributed
systems. I don't feel like I need to read that much more on theory. I
think I'm learning more about how problems are solved in practice from
applied books.

I think I understand HBase/Cassandra much better, and how they might
be used. I understand the purpose of message queue software. I
understand the Lambda Architecture/stream processing idea.

Regarding distributed transactions: I've seen how CockroachDB works,
which puts my mind at ease. I've read a bit on cluster DBs from the
Databases book.

I just don't feel as anxious about this stuff now.
