## Priority Plan

* Finish CS188.
* Finish NN course.
* Read Norvig.
* Read Murphy.
* Read Strang for PCA/SVD.
* Only afterward the above: robotics.

## Others

* Review graphical model inference and learning.
* Learn decision trees, random forests, boosting, bagging.
* Reinforcement learning.
* Learn to train SVM via SMO.
* Conjugate gradient descent.
* Control theory?
* Deep Learning course by Google later.
* TensorFlow.

## Statement

There's so much I could study in this area. But I think it would be
sufficient to just finish the basic coursework and nail down
PCA/SVD. With that, I'll have experience with all major areas of
AI/ML. I could re-evaluate then.
