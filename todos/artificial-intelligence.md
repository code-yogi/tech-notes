## Priority Plan

Mainly need to finish some basic coursework. Then I'll have been
exposed to a little of everything. At that point I could look at a
little math to learn a few things deeper.

* Finish CS188.
* Finish NN course.
* Read Norvig.
* Read Murphy.
* Read Strang for PCA/SVD.
* Only afterward the above: robotics.

## Others

* Review graphical model inference and learning.
* Learn decision trees, random forests, boosting, bagging.
* Reinforcement learning.
* Learn to train SVM via SMO.
* Conjugate gradient descent.
* Control theory?
* Deep Learning course by Google later.
