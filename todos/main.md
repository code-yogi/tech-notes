**Overall Important/Next Steps**

I should focus primarily on artificial intelligence work. There's lots
of interesting stuff throughout Computer Science, but AI is probably
where the most influential breakthroughs are.

* Compilers: book or coursera class?
* Maybe look at Elm/FRP. RxJS?
* Jeff Dean on ML: http://research.google.com/pubs/pub40565.html
* Continue AI/ML courses again. CS188 and Hinton.
* TensorFlow. GPU programming?

**Do not review all files!** The TODO files contain everything I need.
