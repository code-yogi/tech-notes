## Notes

I went through all Coursera, Udacity courses on 2016-03-17. I double
checked on 2016-03-21; I added a few more. OCW doesn't have problem
sets like these do, and I don't think Edx does either.

The plan I set out below should cover enough AI stuff; if I want to go
further, I think it would be a matter of getting a job in that.

## Plan

* Finish Coursera Neural Nets.
* Finish EdX CS188.
* Deep Learning on Udacity.
* AI for Robotics on Udacity.

## Coursera

* Robotics Courses (UPenn; this is not free)
* Digital Signal Processing (EPFL)
* Cluster Analysis in Data Mining (UIUC)
* Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering (Rice)
* Heterogeneous Parallel Programming (UIUC)
* Text Retrieval and Search Engines (UIUC)
* Neural Networks for ML (Toronto)
* Discrete Optimization (Melbourne)
* Not worth covering:
    * Intro to Databases (Stanford)
    * Computer Architecture (Princeton)
    * Compilers (Stanford)
* Already Complete:
    * Machine Learning
    * PGM
    * Mining Massive Datasets (Stanford)

## Udacity

* Introduction to Computer Vision (Georgia Tech)
* Introduction to AI (Norvig/Thrun; prolly book is better?)
* Deep Learning (From Google)
* Artificial Intelligence for Robotics (Thrun, Georgia Tech)
* Machine Learning (Georgia Tech)
* Machine Learning: Unsupervised Learning (Georgia Tech)
* Machine Learning: Reinforcement Learning (Georgia Tech)

## Other

* Convex Optimization (Stephen Boyd)
